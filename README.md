# 📌 Chalet Rental Mobile Application

## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to the **Chalet Rental Mobile Application**, a powerful tool designed for **brokers and renters** to efficiently manage and organize their bookings. This application helps prevent conflicts between different chalets, avoids **double bookings**, and ensures a seamless user experience. 

The system operates on **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, restricting specific actions such as adding, editing, and deleting chalets to **admins only**, while assistants can manage reservations.

## 🔄 Waterfall Model Implementation
This project follows the **Waterfall Model**, ensuring a structured and systematic approach to software development.

### 1️⃣ Requirements Analysis
**Key Features Identified:**
✅ User Authentication (Admin & Assistants)  
✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
✅ Chalet Management (Add, Edit, Delete)  
✅ Reservation System with Conflict Prevention  
✅ View and Track Reservations  
✅ Simple & Efficient UI/UX Design  

### 2️⃣ System Analysis & Design
**Technology Choices:**
- **React Native** – Cross-platform mobile app development
- **Firebase Firestore** – Real-time database for smooth data handling
- **Firebase Authentication** – Secure user logins & role management
- **React Navigation** – Intuitive user experience
- **React Native Paper** – Beautiful UI components

### 3️⃣ Implementation
✔️ Developed **authentication & role-based access**  
✔️ Built the **chalet management system**  
✔️ Designed a **conflict-free reservation system**  
✔️ Integrated **React Navigation & UI components**  

### 4️⃣ Testing
🛠 **Unit Testing** – Ensured correct authentication and data flow  
🔗 **Integration Testing** – Verified reservations & chalet interactions  
📲 **End-to-End Testing** – Simulated real-world user scenarios  

### 5️⃣ Maintenance & Future Enhancements
🔹 **Bug Fixes & Security Patches**  
🔹 **Role & Permission Refinements**  
🔹 **Push Notifications for Booking Updates**  
🔹 **Remote Configuration for Real-Time Changes**

## ⚠️ Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model & Personal Insights
### 🔴 Challenges Faced:
❌ **Lack of Flexibility** – New features required revisiting earlier phases.  
❌ **Late Bug Discovery** – Fixing major issues during testing was time-consuming.  

### 📝 Personal Opinion:
The Waterfall Model works well for small to mid-scale projects where structured development is necessary. However, for larger projects requiring frequent updates, an **Agile methodology** might be a better fit.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 **Improve Input Validation** to enhance security  
🔹 **Add Batch Reservation Processing** for efficiency  
🔹 **Enhance Role Management Features** for scalability  
🔹 **Introduce a Dark Mode UI** for a better user experience
